# Shell Net Builder
This project is aimed at developing a simple GUI based tool to configure HTTP, FTP, DNS, NAT, NFS, DHCP without having any extensive knowledge on console command. This tool is most suitable for home, SOHO as well as where RHEL based network setup required. With all operations a user friendly manual is provided for optimum guidance.

# Product Definition
A simple GUI-based NETWORK BUILDER for a RHEL-based Linux operating system to configure DNS, FTP, HTTP, NFS, NAT without having extensive knowledge about console command. The one click procedure is here to setup all the above mentioned operations where as in real it is required tons of console base command to do so.

# Functional Requirements Definitions:
Functional Requirements are those that refer to the functionality of the system, i.e., what services it will provide to the user. Nonfunctional (supplementary) requirements pertain to other information needed to produce the correct system and are detailed separately.

# Non-functional Requirements Definitions:
Some requirements are not functional. Specifically, these are the constraints the system must work within. The system must be compatible with IBM Websphere Application Server and must have sufficient memory to work with.

# Functions provided:
This project is aimed at developing a simple GUI based tool to configure HTTP, FTP, DNS, NAT, NFS, DHCP without having any extensive knowledge on console command. This tool is most suitable for home , SOHO as well as where RHEL based network setup required. With all operations a user friendly manual is provided for optimum guidance.

NETWORK BUILDER is developed aiming the large number of people who donâ€™t use Linux just because of the complexity of configuring server and its related service such as DHCP, HTTP, FTP, NFS, NAT, DNS etc in spite of tremendous security that comes with RHEL based OS such as Cent OS.

We have chosen this because of making people friendly with Linux so that they can enjoy its built-in security without bothering about lines of commands, which is a major concern for any non-tech-savvy people to deal with.

In future we would like to add many functionaries to make accepted by a major portion. An extensive R&D can make this tool better and better for further use.
