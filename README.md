# shellnetbuilder
This project is aimed at developing a simple GUI based tool to configure HTTP,FTP,DNS,NAT,NFS,DHCP without having any extensive knowledge on console command. This tool is most suitable for home, SOHO as well as where RHEL based network setup required. With all operations a user friendly manual is provided for optimum guidance.

# Product Definition
A simple GUI based NETWORK BUILDER for a RHEL based Linux
operating system to configure DNS,FTP,HTTP,NFS,NAT without having
extensive knowledge about console command . The one click procedure is
here to setup all the above mentioned operations where as in real it is
required tons of console base command to do so.

# Functional Requirements Definitions:
Functional Requirements are those that refer to the functionality of the
system, i.e., what services it will provide to the user. Nonfunctional
(supplementary) requirements pertain to other information needed to
produce the correct system and are detailed separately.

# Non-functional Requirements Definitions:
There are requirements that are not functional in nature. Specifically, these
are the constraints the system must work within. The system must be
compatible with IBM Websphere Application Server and must have a
sufficient memory to work with.

# Functions provided:
This project is aimed at developing a simple GUI based tool to configure
HTTP,FTP,DNS,NAT,NFS,DHCP without having any extensive knowledge on
console command. This tool is most suitable for home , SOHO as well as
where RHEL based network setup required. With all operations a user
friendly manual is provided for optimum guidance

NETWORK BUILDER is developed aiming the large number of
people who donâ€™t use Linux just because of the
complexity of configuring server and its related service
such as DHCP,HTTP,FTP,NFS,NAT,DNS etc in spite of
tremendous security that comes with RHEL based OS
such as Cent OS.

We have chosen this because of making people friendly
with Linux so that they can enjoy its inbuilt security
without bothering about lines of commands that is a
major concern of any non-tech-savvy people to deal with.

In future we would like to add many functionaries to
make accepted by a major portion. An extensive R&D can
make this tool better and better for further use.
